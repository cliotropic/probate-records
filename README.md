# probate-records
Python code to import New England probate records, 1631-1776, from Main, Main, and Lindert's data export

This Python notebook is a demonstration of Python data cleaning with the Pandas library.
It uses a data set created by Gloria L. Main and Jackson T. Main and edited by Gloria L.
Main and Peter H. Lindert, July 2013. The original data set is available for download at 
<http://eh.net/database/new-england-1631-1776-sample-of-18509-probates/>. 

This code is largely a proof of concept. If you use or extend this code, please do
